# Legend of the Green Dragon modules
Additional modules not included in the core of Legend of the Green Dragon.

# Requirements
In order to use these modules you either need my version of Legend of the Green Dragon, or the version from [Oliver Brendel](https://github.com/NB-Core/lotgd), which mine is based on.

# Additional modules
You can find some additional modules made by my good friend [Oliver Brendel](https://github.com/NB-Core/modules).
Both my modules, as well as the modules from Oliver assume a working and correctly installed instance of either my Gielinor edition, or the NB core.

# Currently available modules

- Skills Core
Enables the player skills. When enabled it allows players to train a new set of skills such as Firemaking, Mining, Smithing etc. This module will eventually be extended to allow all RuneScape skills from Old School RuneScape.
